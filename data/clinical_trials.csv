Symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). The total score of the 10 items ranges from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome.

Each symptom is rated from 0 (absent) to 4 (maximum severity). Total scores range from 0 to 56 where <17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe. Total scores above 30 indicate very severe anxiety Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) total score - from baseline to Week 8 The HADS is a patient-rated scale designed to screen for anxiety and depressive states in medical patients. It consists of two sub-scales: the D-scale measures depression and the A-scale measures anxiety. Each sub-scale contains 7 items, and each item is rated from 0 (absent) to 3 (maximum severity). The score of each sub-scale ranges from 0 to 21 Change in Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) total score - from baseline to Week 8 The FAST is a valid and reliable instrument, easy to apply which requires a short period of time to administer. Evaluates functioning taking into account the last 15 days. It was developed for the clinical evaluation of the main difficulties presented by psychiatric patients, and has been validated in several languages for patients with bipolar disorder. The FAST scale consists of 24 items which allow the assessment of six specific areas of functioning: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive functioning, financial issues, interpersonal relationships and leisure time.Each item is rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The items are summed to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 72 with higher scores reflecting more serious difficulties Change in Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score - from baseline to Week 8 The Clinical Global Impression severity of illness (CGI-S) provides the clinician's impression of the patient's current state of mental illness. The clinician uses his or her clinical experience of this patient population to rate the severity of the patient's current mental illness on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal - not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients) Clinical Global Impression Scale- Global Improvement (CGI-I) score - At Week 8 The Clinical Global Impression - global improvement CGI-I provides the clinician's impression of the patient's improvement (or worsening). The clinician assesses the patient's condition relative to a baseline on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) Change in Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) total score - from baseline to Week 8 The original Q-LES-Q is a patient self-rated scale designed to measure the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced by patients in various areas of daily life.

Symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). The total score of the 10 items ranges from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome.;"Remission (defined as a MADRS total score =<10) (Time Frame: At Week 8)  The Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a 10-item rating scale designed to assess the severity of the symptoms in depressive illness and to be sensitive to treatment effects. Symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). The total score of the 10 items ranges from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome. Response (defined as a => 50% decrease from baseline in MADRS total score) (Time Frame: At Week 8)  The Montgomery and Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a 10-item rating scale designed to assess the severity of the symptoms in depressive illness and to be sensitive to treatment effects. Symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). The total score of the 10 items ranges from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome.  Change in MADRS anhedonia factor score (Time Frame: From baseline to Week 8)  (based on items 1(apparent sadness),2 (reported sadness),6 (concentration difficulties),7 (lassitude),8 (inability to feel)) Change in Digital Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) total score (Time Frame: From baseline to Week 8)  DSST assesses psychomotor speed of performance requiring visual perception, spatial decision-making, and motor skills. It consists of 133 digits and requires the patient to substitute each digit with a simple symbol in a 90-s period. Each correct symbol is counted, and the total score ranges from 0 ( normal functioning). The proportion number of Hard Choice/number of High Reward trials and number of Low choice/number of Low Reward trials when performing the Effort- Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT) [ Time Frame: From baseline to Week 8 ]  The EEfRT is a computerized task which measures reward motivation in which participants are presented with a series of repeated trials during which they choose between performing a ''hard-task'' or an ''easy-task'' in order to earn varying amounts of monetary rewards. Change in Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score (Time Frame: From baseline to Week 8)  The CGI-S scale measures the severity of psychiatric symptoms on a 7-point scale from 1-7. The scores indicated the following: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill participants. The score ranged from 1-7, where 1 indicated absence of symptoms and higher score indicated greater severity of symptoms. Clinical Global Impression Scale- Global Improvement (CGI-I) score(Time Frame: at Day 7,28,56)  The Clinical Global Impression - global improvement CGI-I provides the clinician's impression of the patient's improvement (or worsening). The clinician assesses the patient's condition relative to a baseline on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) Change in Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) total score (Time Frame: From baseline to Week 8)  The FAST is a valid and reliable instrument, easy to apply which requires a short period of time to administer. Evaluates functioning taking into account the last 15 days. It was developed for the clinical evaluation of the main difficulties presented by psychiatric patients, and has been validated in several languages for patients with bipolar disorder. The FAST scale consists of 24 items which allow the assessment of six specific areas of functioning: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive functioning, financial issues, interpersonal relationships and leisure time Change in FAST sub-domain scores (Time Frame: From baseline to Week 8)  The FAST is a clinician-rated scale designed to assess difficulty in functioning. The FAST consists of 24 items in 6 specific areas of functioning: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive functioning, financial issues, interpersonal relationships, leisure time. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The items are summed to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 72 with higher scores reflecting more serious difficulties Change in Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) total score [ Time Frame: From baseline to Week 8 ]  The original Q-LES-Q is a patient self-rated scale designed to measure the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced by patients in various areas of daily life.

The date of the second MADRS assessment will be used for the date of relapse; (b) Any psychiatric hospitalization for: worsening of depression, suicide prevention or due to a suicide attempt for any of these events, the start date of hospitalization will be used for the date of relapse; (c) Suicide attempt, completed suicide, or any other clinically relevant event determined per the investigator's clinical judgment to be indicative of a relapse of depressive illness, but for which the participant was not hospitalized. The onset of the event will be used for the date of relapse Change from Baseline in Clinician-rated MADRS Scale Score - Baseline up to Week 32 The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity and detect changes due to anti depressants (AD) treatment. The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition. The MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, inability to feel (interest level), pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts Change from Baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) Scale Score - Baseline up to Week 32 The CGI-S measures illness severity and is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through to 7 (among the most severely ill participants) Clinical Global Impression - Change (CGI-C) Scale Score - Baseline up to Week 32 The CGI-C rating scale is a global assessment that measures the clinician's impression illness change. CGI-C scores range from 1 (very much improved) through to 7 (very much worse) as compared to baseline Change from Baseline in Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) 9-item Total Score - Baseline up to Week 32 The PHQ-9 is a validated 9-item, PRO measure to assess depressive symptoms. The scale scores each of the 9-symptom domains of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition major depressive disorder (DSM-5 MDD) criteria. Each item is rated on a 4 point scale (0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, and 3=nearly every day). The participant's item responses are summed to provide a total score (range of 0 to 27), with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms Change from Baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score - Baseline up to Week 32 The SDS, a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure, is a 5-item questionnaire that has been widely used and accepted for assessment of functional impairment and associated disability. The first 3 items cover (1) work/school, (2) social life, and (3) family life/home responsibilities using a rating scale from 0 to 10. The SDS also has 1 item assessing days lost from school or work and 1 item assessing days of underproductivity. The score for the first 3 items are summed to create a total score of 0 to 30, where higher score indicates greater impairment Change from Baseline in Health-Related Quality of life Status as Assessed by 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Domain Scores - Baseline up to Week 32 The SF-36 is a validated 36-item questionnaire which measures quality of life across 8 domains, which are both physically and emotionally based. The 8 domains that the SF-36 measures are as follows: physical functioning; role limitations due to physical health; role limitations due to emotional problems; energy/fatigue; emotional wellbeing; social functioning; pain; general health. A single item is also included that identifies perceived change in health, making the SF 36 a useful indicator for change in quality of life over time and treatment. For each of the 8 domains that the SF-36 measures, an aggregate score is produced. The scores range from 0 (lowest or worst possible level of functioning) to 100 (highest or best possible level of functioning) Change from Baseline in Quality of Life in Depression Scale (QLDS) Total Score - Baseline up to Week 32 The QLDS is a disease specific PRO designed to assess health related quality of life in patients with Major Depressive Disorder. The instrument has a recall period of at the moment, contains 34-items with yes/no response options. The total score is computed as sum of the items with range from 0 (good quality of life) to 34 (very poor quality of life) Change from Baseline in European Quality of Life (EuroQol) Group, 5 Dimension, 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) - Baseline up to Week 32 The EQ-5D-5L is standardized instrument for use as measure of health outcome, primarily designed for self-completion by respondents. It consists of EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and EQ-VAS. EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: Mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each of 5 dimensions is divided into 5 levels of perceived problems (1 indicating no problem, 2 indicating slight problems, 3 indicating moderate problems, 4 indicating severe problems, 5 indicating extreme problems). Participant selects an answer for each of 5 dimensions considering the response that best matches his or her health today. The responses to the 5 dimensions are used to compute a single score ranging from zero (0.0- worst health state) to 1 (1.0- better health state) representing the general health status of the individual Change from Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI): Specific Health Problem (SHP) Questionnaire - Baseline up to Week 32 The WPAI:SHP questionnaire is a validated short instrument that assesses impairment in work and other regular activities over the past 7 days. The WPAI questionnaire assesses 4 separate measures: absenteeism (ie, the proportion of work time missed due to MDD), presenteeism (ie, the degree of impairment while working due to MDD), work productivity loss (ie, overall work impairment due to MDD/absenteeism plus presenteeism), and activity impairment (ie, the degree of impairment of regular, nonwork activity due to MDD). The WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity, that is, worse outcomes Number of Participants with Intervention-Emergent Adverse Events - Up to 32 Weeks  Intervention-emergent adverse events (AEs) are AEs occurring or worsening in severity after the start of study intervention. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug Suicidal ideation and behavior as Assessed by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Score - Up to 32 Weeks  Suicidal ideation or behavior will be measured using C-SSRS score. C-SSRS is a clinician rated assessment of suicidal behavior and/ or intent. Scale consists of 28 items in 4 sections: suicide behavior, actual attempts, suicidal ideation, and intensity of ideation. Suicidal ideation consists of 5 yes/no items: wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation with any methods (not plan) without intention to act, active suicidal ideation with some intent to act without specific plan, active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent.

The most common adverse events were classified as infections. The rate of adverse events leading to treatment withdrawals existed consistent with additional subject exposure.The most common serious infections were pneumonia and urinary tract infections (UTIs). The rate per 100 patient years of serious infections elevated from year 3 to year 5 among subjects with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. There was no change observed in the pattern or type of serious infections over time.There were no fatal cases of serious opportunistic infections observed. Some other individual cases of serious opportunistic infections were observed without any pattern in the type of infection. The crude incidence rate of malignancy per 100 patient years (PY) in ocrelizumab all-exposure population existed and fluctuated within an epidemiological range for subjects with multiple sclerosis over time.Consistent age- and sex-standardised incidence rate of malignancy was observed in the ocrelizumaball-exposure population excluding the non-melanoma skin cancer per 100 patient years. In the ocrelizumaball-exposure population, the crude incidence rate of female breast cancer was consistent over time and the age-standardised incidence rate also stable with the confidence intervals overlapping over time.A total of two serious opportunistic infections were observed in subjects from ocrelizumab clinical trials. Long-term follow-up and post-marketing requirement studies were used to monitor the safety over time in subjects with multiple sclerosis receiving ocrelizumab, including the identified and potential risks.http://www.professionalabstracts.com/ectrims2018/iplanner/#/presentation/1768  and https://www.ocrelizumabinfo.com/content/dam/gene/ocrelizumabinfo/pdfs/safety-of-ocrelizumab-in-multiple-sclerosis.pdfJune 2019Presented at the 5th Congress of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN 2019), June 29 - July 02, 2019, Oslo, NorwaySafety of ocrelizumab in multiple sclerosis: updated analysis in patients with relapsing and primary progressive multiple sclerosisSession: MS and related disorders 3Abstract No.: EPR2072Hauser SL et al,Based on the pooled results of NCT00676715, NCT01247324, NCT01412333, NCT02545868, NCT02637856, NCT02688985, NCT03085810, EudraCT-2015-005597-38 and NCT01194570 presented, GlobalData inferred that adverse events, serious AEs, serious infections, infections and malignancy was reported in subjects.

The investigational product (gantenerumab or placebo) is injected subcutaneously into the abdominal wallA positron emission tomography (PET) imaging substudy is conducted within the main study. Eligible patients who provide separate informed consent undergo up to four PET imaging scans using the radioligand florbetapir as a pharmacodynamic measure of changes in brain amyloid load over time.Following post week-24 MRI results not confirming the significant ARIA findings (no ARIA-E and no greater than one new microbleed), subjects received 225 mg. In case of ARIA-E findings, subjects either remained on the 105 mg dose (if ARIA-E less than 2 cm) or their dose withhold (if symptomatic ARIA-E, ARIA-E > 2 cm or multiple ARIA-E,) with monthly MRI monitoring during the treatment. Subjects receiving gantenerumab started at 105 mg and up-titrated to 225 mg at week 28 if an MRI scan confirmed no significant amyloid-related imaging abnormalities.Subjects were assigned to 1 of 4 titration schemes based on last double-blind dose and apolipoprotein E4 genotype. A total of 180 subjects were exposed to 1200mg gantenerumab (range 3–85 weeks).Target dose of 1200mg gantenerumab and titration schemes were modelled based on all available data with mAb targeting aggregated amyloid to achieve maximum amyloid reduction while maintaining safety and tolerability.A total of 389 subjects are enrolled in the study.;;As per the company update presentation at the Kepler Chevreux German Corporate Conference January 2019, study data read outs potentially due until end of 2019.https://www.morphosys.com/sites/default/files/phone-conferences/downloads/190121_mor_company_update_incl_appendix.pdf (Slide no. 29)As per the company update presentation September 2018, study data read out expected in 2018.https://www.morphosys.com/sites/default/files/phone-conferences/downloads/180907_mor_company_update_incl_appendix_final.pdf (Slide no. 21, 25)As per the company update presentation Aug 2018, study data read out expected in 2018.https://www.morphosys.com/sites/default/files/phone-conferences/downloads/mor_company_update_august.pdf (Slides 21, 25)As per the company update presentation at the DS Berlin Conference June 2018, data read-out from the study expected in 2018.https://www.morphosys.com/sites/default/files/presentations/mor_company_update_inkl_appendix_june.pdf (Slide no. 25)As per the corporate presentation February 2018, data read-out from the study expected in third quarter of 2018.http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9Njg5MjQwfENoaWxkSUQ9Mzk5NjA1fFR5cGU9MQ==&t=1 (Slide 09)As per the company update presentation at the 7th LEERINK Partners Annual Global Healthcare Conference February 2018, the study was ongoing and trial data readouts expected in 2018.http://wsw.com/webcast/leerink30/mor.de/ (Slides 14, 17)As per the company presentation at the 36th Annual J.P.

CSF samples were taken from all subjects at baseline, Week 52 (optional) and Week 104.Subjects (n=114) were enrolled in a PET sub-study (AmyvidTM) with PET scans carried out at baseline, 20, 60 and 100 weeks.Subjects were randomized based on the APOEe4 alelle status and CSF biomarkers are analyzed using the Elecsys ß-Amyloid(1–42), tTau and pTau(181P) immunoassays which were the products of Roche diagnostics. Standardized uptake value( SUVr) was normalized to different reference regions.Subjects who did not meet a diagnosis of dementia, were further screened for low CSF Aß42 levels, using a CSF Aß assay (INNOTEST ß-AMYLOID1–42, Innogenetics).Psychometrics of ADAS-Cog, CDR, FAQ, FCSRT and MMSE Psychometrics of ADAS-Cog, CDR, FAQ, FCSRT and MMSE were evaluated by assessment of floor and ceiling effects, test–retest reliability, (intra-class correlation coefficients), internal consistency of summary scores (Cronbach’s a) and construct validity (Spearman correlation coefficients and t-tests). Furthermore, sensitivity to change is assessed via calculation of standardized response means for the change from baseline (mean change divided by standard deviation of change) to Week 104 in subjects randomized to placebo only.At the futility analysis, 312 subjects had completed treatment. Disease progression was analyzed as time to =1-point change from baseline in CDR-SB within 128 weeks. Prognostic performance of the model, selected submodels and individual baseline covariates was summarized as hazard ratios of median splits to exclude subjects with a low likelihood of disease progression. The optimal model is validated with the independent subject cohort receiving gantenerumab 225mgCSF neurogranin and YKL-40 were measured using ELISA assays. Relationships between individual biomarkers and between biomarkers and exploratory clinical outcomes were investigated.Subjects are randomized to receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of either gantenerumab or placebo. Subjects who consent to be part of the sub study undergo positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to assess brain amyloid. The anticipated time on study treatment is 104 weeks in Part 1, with an option for an additional up to 2 years of treatment in Part 2, followed by an open-label extension (Part 3) until July 2020.The dosing for Parts 1 and 2 was stopped after a planned futility interim analysis showed a low probability of meeting the primary outcome measure with the doses studied. The study has converted to open-label to investigate higher gantenerumab doses.Subsequent to DB treatment suspension, subjects entered a follow-up treatment-free period.A total of 799 subjects were enrolled in this study.;;As of April 2019, study data and safety findings were expected to be presented at the 71st American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting.https://www.gene.com/media/press-releases/14784/2019-04-28/new-genentech-data-at-the-2019-aan-annuaAs per the company presentation at JMP Securities Life Science Conference, study was ongoing and trial data readouts expected in 2018.https://www.morphosys.com/sites/default/files/phone-conferences/downloads/180619_mor_company_presentation_booklet.pdf (Slide No: 25, 30)As per the company update presentation May 2018, study data read out expected in 2018.https://www.morphosys.com/sites/default/files/phone-conferences/downloads/180514_mor_company_update_inkl_appendix.pdf (Slide no. 24)As per the full year 2016 results presentation appendix, enrollment was completed in the fourth quarter 2013, dosing was stopped due to futility in the fourth quarter of 2014 and first subject was in in the open-label extension study was in the fourth quarter 2015.http://www.roche.com/dam/jcr:84682517-4058-444a-952b-552ef7e14b5f/en/irp170201-a.pdf(Slide 128)As of may 2016, a total of 799 subjects were actually enrolled in the study.As per the company presentation at the 32nd Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, trial data are expected in 2016.As per the Morphosys company presentation at the Jefferies 2014 Global Healthcare Conference, trial data are expected in 2016.As of December 2014, the company announced the decision to discontinue the trial based on results from prepre-plannedtility analysis and recommendation of independent Data Monitoring Committee.As per the company presentation at the 33rd Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, the trial was discontinued and data from the study was shared by Roche with the medical community after full review and analysis.As per the full year 2014 results, enrollment of subjects was completed in the fourth quarter of 2013.

If subject has elevations only in total bilirubin that are >ULN and <1.5xULN, fractionate bilirubin to identify possible undiagnosed Gilbert's syndrome (ie, direct bilirubin <35%). N01349 subjects with a total bilirubin > ULN may be considered for the study if benign unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is suspected in the context of prolonged neonatal jaundice, after discussion with the medical monitor. For randomized subjects with a baseline result >ULN for ALT, AST, ALP, or total bilirubin, a baseline diagnosis and/or the cause of any clinically meaningful elevation must be understood and recorded in the eCRF. If subject has >ULN ALT, AST, or ALP that does not meet the exclusion limit at the baseline referenced in Table 5-1 for LTFU subjects and at the Screening Visit for directly enrolled subjects, repeat the tests, if possible, prior to dosing to ensure there is no further ongoing clinically relevant increase. In case of a clinically relevant increase, inclusion of the subject must be discussed with the Medical Monitor. Tests that result in ALT, AST, or ALP up to 25% above the exclusion limit may be repeated once for confirmation.

Mechanisms of Drug Resistance 1Poster Borad No: 9Abstract No.: 298Javier Carmona F et al.Based on the results presented, GlobalData inferred that the three subjects who experienced disease progression after initial benefit from neratinib treatment, exhibited a common genomic alteration in tumors.Targeted exome sequencing of biopsies obtained at the time of progression demonstrated an increased ERBB2-mutant allele copy number.In one sample, the resistant lesions were observed to be avid for zirconium-89-trastuzumab and the subject had shown response to subsequent antibody-based anti-ERBB2 treatment. In an attempt to confirm that increased expression of the mutant allele was sufficient to limit neratinib sensitivity, we measured the antitumor activity of this agent in MCF10A cells stably expressing a several activating mutations of ERBB2 as compared to the cells expressing equal levels of the wild type receptor. An analysis was performed to confirm the increased expression of the mutant allele was sufficient to limit neratinib sensitivity, which revealed that higher neratinib concentrations were required to hinder the proliferation of ERBB2-mutant cells in comparison with wild-type. Moreover, increased receptor activity in the ERBB2-mutant cells associated with an enhanced formation of ERBB2/ERBB3 dimers, PI3K/AKT pathway activation and in-vivo tumorigenic potential. A combined inhibition of ERBB2 and ERBB3 efficiently hindered the phosphorylation of ERBB2/ERBB3 and cell proliferation.Amplification of mutated ERBB2ERBB2 supports an increased dimerization of ERBB2/ERBB3, activation of ERBB3, and successive downstream signaling activation. Dual prohibition of ERBB2/ERBB3 was a potential strategy to delay or inhibit the neratinib resistance in ERBB2-mutant breast tumors.http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?sKey=584f0102-f232-46c2-b0e6-a37f73f4a9d5&cKey=3960a711-7fb5-45ad-a9e0-e0056c0b5047&mKey=1d10d749-4b6a-4ab3-bcd4-f80fb1922267December 07, 2016Presented at the 39th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), December 06-10, 2016, San Antonio, Texas, United statesNeratinib + fulvestrant in ERBB2-mutant, HER2–non-amplified, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, metastatic breast cancer (MBC): Preliminary analysis from the phase II SUMMIT trialSession: Poster Discussion: Endocrine Resistance: Mechanisms and MarkersAbstract No.: PD2-08Hyman D et al.Based on the results presented, GlobalData inferred that 35 efficacy-evaluable ERBB2-mutant MBC subjects were analyzed.Efficacy findings:ParameterNeratinib monotherapy (n=24)Neratinib + fulvestrant (n=11)Best Overall Response (confirmed and unconfirmed), n (%) [95% CI]8 (33.3)	[15.6–55.3]6 (54.5)	[23.4–83.3]CR3 (12.5)2 (18.2)PR5 (20.8)4 (36.4)ORR at 8 weeks, n (%)	[95% CI]8 (33.3)	[15.6–55.3]5 (45.5)a	[16.7–76.6]CR2 (8.3)2 (18.2)PR6 (25.0)3 (27.3)ORR confirmed, n (%)	[95% CI]5 (20.8)	[7.1–42.2]2 (18.2)b	[2.3–51.8]CR3 (12.5)1 (9.1)PR2 (8.3)1 (9.1)CBR, n (%)	[95% CI]10 (41.7)	[22.1–63.4]6 (54.5)	[23.4–83.3]CR - complete response; PR - partial response	aThere was 1 subject with PR at week 16; bAt time of data cut-off 4 subjects are still on treatment.http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs/view.php?nu=SABCS16L_987December 08, 2016Presented at the 39th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), December 06-10, 2016, San Antonio, Texas, United statesAn acquired HER2 T798I gatekeeper mutation induces resistance to neratinib in a patient with HER2 mutant-driven breast cancerSession: Poster Session 3: Tumor Cell and Molecular Biology: Drug ResistanceAbstract No.: P3-03-03Hanker AB et al.Based on the results presented, Globaldata inferred that there was an increased of bulk of the isoleucine at position 798 and would result in a steric clash with neratinib, thus reducing drug binding. HER2WT, HER2T798I, HER2L869R and HER2L869R/T798I in MCF10A cells expressed consistently.HER2-mediated signaling was blocked by neratinib (10-100 nM) in cells expressing HER2WT or HER2L869R but did not in cells expressing HER2T798I.The EGFR irreversible TKI osimertinib (100 nM), which isselective for mutant EGFR (including EGFRT790M) and approved for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer expressing EGFRT790M, failed to inhibit HER2L869R, HER2WT or HER2T798I.Either the EGFR/HER2 irreversible TKI afatinib or AZ5104, a metabolite of osimertinib, blocked signaling induced by HER2WT, HER2L869R or HER2T798I. Cells expressing HER2T798M showed a remarkably higher IC50 to neratinib than cells expressing HER2WT, whereas afatinib or AZ5014 were very active against all cells (IC50<10 nM).http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs/view.php?nu=SABCS16L_294April 02, 2017Puma Biotechnology Presents Results from the Phase II SUMMIT Trial of PB272 for ERBB2 (HER2) Mutant, HER2 Non-Amplified, Metastatic Cancer at the 2017 AACR Annual MeetingBased on the result announced by the Puma Biotechnology, in the press release, GlobalData inferred that a total of 141 subjects were analyzed including 124 with HER2 mutations and 17 with HER3 mutations. Findings:HER2mutHER2mutHER2mutHER2mutHER2mutHER2mutHER3mutBreastBladderLungColorectalBiliary tractCervicalNOS(n=25)(n=16)(n=26)(n=12)(n=9)(n=5)(n=17)ORR at week 8,n (%)8 (32.0)0 (0.0)1 (3.8)0 (0.0)2 (22.2)1 (20.0)0 (0.0)(95% CI)(14.9--53.5)(0.0--20.6)(0.1--19.6)(0.0--26.5)(2.8--60.0)(0.5--71.6)(0.0--20.6)Clinical benefitrate, n (%)10 (40.0)3 (18.8)11 (42.3)1 (8.3)3 (33.3)3 (60.0)2 (11.8)(95% CI)(21.1--61.3)(4.0--45.6)(23.4--63.1)(0.2--38.5)(7.5--70.1)(14.7--94.7)(1.6--38.3)Median PFS,months3.51.85.51.82.820.11.7(95% CI)(1.9--4.3)(1.7--3.5)(2.7--10.9)(1.4--1.9)(0.5--3.7)(0.5--NA)(1.4--2.0)Clinical activity was not observed in the HER3-mutant cohort.

In one subject with only a sample obtained at progression, the ERBB2 mutation was observed in this study.The ERBB2 mutation was observed in a singular on treatment sample obtained from a subejct with continued response to the therapy. There were eight ERBB2 mutations noticed at the baseline cfDNA sample of one subject with a hypermutated tumor, six of which were not noticed by tissue NGS.An emergence of at least one additional ERBB2 mutation was observed in 3/7 subjects with paired baseline, and progression samples, including subjects with 2, and 5 acquired ERBB2 mutations. The ERBB2 mutant allele fraction (MAF) had increased when compared to the baseline in 4/7 of subjects at the time of progression and reduced in 2/2 subjects with continued response to the therapy. The cfDNA NGS detected mutations, unidentified by the tissue NGS in 9/10 baseline samples, and in 11/12 subjects, including 5 ESR1 mutations in 3 subjects in this study.The cfDNA NGS was sensitive for detection of ERBB2 mutations. The MAF dynamics typically tracked response to, or progression on the therapy, at the time of cfDNA collection. The emergence of an additional ERBB2 mutations were common at the time of progression. However, the T798 gatekeeper mutation was not observed during the treatment. There were many subclonal mutations were noticed on cfDNA NGS, which were not observed on tissue NGS during the treatment.http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4562/presentation/9583October 01, 2018Presented at the Cantor Fitzgerald's 4th Annual Healthcare Conference 2018, October 1-3, 2018, New York, NY, USABased on the results presented, GlobalData inferred that objective response rates of 33% and 58.3% were observed with neratinib monotherapy (n=25) and neratinib+fulvestrant therapy (n=17), respectively.http://wsw.com/webcast/cantor7/pbyi/?lobby=true&day=1 (Slide 33, 34)Based on the results reported, neratinib as a single agent and in combination with fulvestrant was effective in subjects with ERBB2 mutant, HER2 non-amplified, metastatic breast cancer.December 06, 2018Puma Biotechnology Presents Results from the Phase II SUMMIT Trial of Neratinib for ERBB2 (HER2) Mutant, HER2 Non-Amplified, Metastatic Breast Cancer at the 2018 San Antonio Breast Cancer SymposiumBased on the results announced in press release, GlobalData inferred that 47 subjects were evaluable for efficacy.

Three subjects (15.8%) reduced neratinib dose due to diarrhea but no subejcts discontinued treatment due to diarrhea.https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/7946/presentation/560December 11, 2019Puma Biotechnology presents results from the Phase II SUMMIT Trial of Neratinib for ERBB2 (HER2) Mutant, HER2 Non-Amplified, Metastatic Breast Cancer at the 2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer SymposiumBased on the interim results announced by Puma Biotechnology, Inc, in the press release, GlobalData inferred that the safety profile observed in subjects treated with the combination of neratinib plus trastuzumab plus fulvestrant in the study was consistent with that observed previously in metastatic subjects with HER2 amplified tumors.All subjects received anti-diarrheal prophylaxis with loperamide alone.The interim safety results of the study showed that the most frequently observed adverse event was diarrhea.For the 28 safety evaluable subjects enrolled in this cohort, 10 subjects (36%) reported grade 3 diarrhea.The median duration of grade 3 diarrhea for those subjects was 5.5 days.No subject permanently discontinued neratinib due to diarrhea.https://investor.pumabiotechnology.com/press-release/featured-release/puma-biotechnology-presents-results-phase-ii-summit-trial-neratinib-eDecember 14, 2019Presented at the 42nd Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), December 10 - 14, 2019, San Antonio, Texas, USAPoster No.:P1-19-08Hans Wildiers et al.Based on the results presented, GlobalData inferred thatAdverse event, n (%)Safety evaluable patients (n=28)All gradesGrade 3 or 4Subjects with at least 1 adverse event, n (%)26 (93)16 (67)Diarrhea24 (86)10 (36)Nausea15 (54)0Decreased appetite8 (29)1 (4)Constipation10 (36)0Fatigue8 (29)1 (4)Stomatitis5 (18)0Muscle spasms5 (18)0Myalgia5 (18)0Urinary tract infection5 (18)0http://www.pumabiotechnology.com/docs/121119_Puma_at_SABCS_2019_SUMMIT_Poster.pdfJuly 27, 2020Puma Biotechnology Announces Publication of Results from Phase II SUMMIT Trial Evaluating Neratinib in HER2-Mutant, Metastatic Cervical CancersBased on the results announced by the Puma Biotechnology in the press release, GlobalData inferred that safety profile observed in neratinib-treated cervical cancer subjects in SUMMIT was consistent with that reported for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Diarrhea (75%), nausea (44%), and decreased appetite (38%) were the most common of all grade adverse events. One subject (6%) reported grade 3 diarrhea.The rate of grade 3 diarrhea was considerably lower than reported for metastatic breast cancer subjects.

Progression will be defined according to the RANO criteria Toxicity  The toxicity assessment will be conducted using the NCICTC V4 on the whole duration of treatment in all treatment arms, using a list of selected toxicity items for the most frequent expected toxicities and text fields for unexpected events and other less frequent toxicities For each experimental treatment given in combination with radiotherapy, toxicity will be carefully monitored, based on the estimated proportion of patients experiencing Grade 3/4 CTCAE adverse event reported as a SAE, both in the first 8 weeks of treatment and on the whole treatment duration, excluding symptoms that are related to tumour progression or pseudi progression (neurological deterioration, increased intracranial pressure) Each of these adverse event must be communicated directly to the trial manager team and the sponsor coordinator Feasibility  duration of treatment and description of the reasons for treatment discontinuation number of treatment temporary stops and dosereductions and the description of the reasons for these treatment modifications, and estimate of mean dose per week over the whole treatment duration Translational study  Response to therapy (PFS and OS) will be correlated to the biomarkers identified before the start and during the course of the study Correlation of Multimodal Imaging with Response to Therapy  The value of multimodal imaging to predict response to therapy will be evaluated T1weighted postgadolinium imaging will be correlated with outcome since the presence of enhancement could be correlated with survival in one recent study (Hipp 2011) MRS: multivoxel proton spectroscopy will be used to assess metabolic profile especially citrate as well as Cho:Cr and Cho:NAA ratios, the latter being correlated to prognosis (Hipp 2011, SteffenSmith 2011 & 2012) DCEMRI: dynamic contrastenhanced MRI will be used to assess perfusion since increased perfusion could predict survival (Hipp 2011); the sequences will be analysed centrally with the OLEA software ASL: arterial spinlabelling perfusion MRI will be assessed as a possible surrogate for DCEMRI. Guidelines from the ASL Network (http://www.aslnetwork.org) will be implemented DWI: diffusionweighted imaging will be used to assess the apparent diffusion coefficient as a surrogate of tumour cellularity (Gauvain 2001) To compare the 2-year OS between randomised subsets of patients (pairwise comparisons) and compared to historical controls To evaluate the safety profile of each of the three drugs when administered in combination with radiotherapy, and over the whole duration of treatment, as well as the feasibility of a continuous administration of these drugs To evaluate the efficacy in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) of erlotinib, everolimus and dasatinib in combination with radiation therapy, comparatively between randomised subsets of patients, and also compared to historical controls To evaluate the whole strategy by estimating the overall and progression-free survival of the entire cohort (by pooling the different treatment arms) and comparing it to historical controls";"Denmark: Danish Health and Medicines Authority (DHMA)

Further, blood samples will be obtained from the subjects and analyzed in order to reveal gene expression and molecular level correlates underlying rapid antidepressant effects, and to identify biomarkers that predict treatment outcome.A total of 60 subjects are planned to be enrolled in the study.;;;01-Sep-2018;01-Jan-2020;16,23;60;;;;;;;;;;"Primary Intervention

Subjects must be eligible for anthracycline and rituximab (or other CD20-targeted agent) containing regimen as induction prior to consolidation with JCAR017** Cohort 5: Subjects with PCNSL who failed first line therapy with HDCT and ASCT Cohort 6: (REMOVED) Cohort 7: Subjects meeting eligibility criteria for Cohort 1 and suitable for outpatient treatment***  For subjects with transformed disease, the subject should have had at least 2 lines of systemic therapy for his/her transformed disease (ie, DLBCL) for Cohort 1 and 1 line for Cohort 2 to be eligible. Lines of therapy do not include those given for a previously indolent condition (ie, follicular lymphoma). Subjects do NOT have to have anthracycline for their DLBCL if received for indolent disease For subjects already undergoing anthracycline and rituximab containing regimen, eligibility is to be discussed with Medical Monitor. Subjects with complete metabolic response after 2 cycles of induction will proceed with JCAR017 infusion only at time of relapse, if applicable  Subjects must meet the conditions for outpatient treatment and monitoring as outlined in the Outpatient Administration and Monitoring Guidance for Lisocabtagene Maraleucel Note: Subjects with secondary CNS lymphoma involvement may enroll in Cohorts 1 to 4 and 7; subjects with PCNSL are eligible for Cohort 5 Subject selection must consider clinical risk factors for severe adverse events (AEs) and alternative treatment options. Subjects should only be enrolled if the Investigator considers the potential benefit outweighs the risk for the subject. For Cohort 5 and to not compromise safety, subject selection has been restricted to those fit enough to HDCT and ASCT as their prior therapy Histological confirmation of diagnosis at last relapse. Enough tumor material must be available for central confirmation of diagnosis, otherwise a new tumor biopsy is mandated Note: If the subject did not experience CR since last biopsy, the most recent biopsy will be considered adequate to participate in the trial. For subjects with PCNSL, at a minimum, corresponding pathology report is required if archival tumor material is not available and repeated biopsy not feasible (REMOVED) For subjects with NHL and Richter's transformed CLL For subjects with PCNSL: Subjects must have disease that is objectively measurable by International Workshop to Standardize Baseline Evaluation and Response Criteria in Primary Central Nervous System (CNS) Lymphoma (Abrey, 2005), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology (in case of leptomeningeal only disease), or vitreal aspiration cytology and/or retinal photographs (in case of ocular lymphoma if clinically indicated) Adequate organ function, defined as:  Adequate bone marrow function to receive LD chemotherapy as assessed by the Investigator Serum creatinine < 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance > 30 mL/min (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] by Cockroft Gault) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 5 x ULN and total bilirubin < 2.0 mg/dL (or < 3.0 mg/dL for subjects with Gilbert's syndrome or lymphomatous infiltration of the liver) Adequate pulmonary function, defined as = Grade 1 dyspnea according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and SaO2 = 92% on room air Adequate cardiac function, defined as LVEF = 40% as assessed by echocardiogram or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan performed within 4 weeks prior to leukapheresis Adequate vascular access for leukapheresis procedure Subjects must agree to not donate blood, organs, sperm or semen, and egg cells for usage in other individuals after the JCAR017 infusion Female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) must:  Have two negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator (one negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin [ß-hCG] pregnancy test result at screening and one negative serum pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to the first dose of LD chemotherapy). This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence* from heterosexual contact Either commit to true abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without interruption. Contraception methods must include 1 highly effective (barrier) method of contraception from screening until at least 12 months following LD chemotherapy Note: Highly effective methods are defined as those that result in a low failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. The following are examples of contraception: Highly effective methods:  Intrauterine device (IUD) Hormonal (birth control pill, injections, implants) Tubal ligation Partner's vasectomy c) Agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 12 months following LD chemotherapy d) There is insufficient exposure data to provide any recommendation concerning the duration of contraception and the abstaining from breastfeeding following treatment with JCAR017. Any decision regarding contraception and breastfeeding after JCAR017 infusion should be discussed with the treating physician 14. Male subjects must:  Practice true abstinence* (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating in the study and until at least 12 months following LD chemotherapy even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy There is insufficient exposure data to provide any recommendation concerning the duration of contraception following treatment with JCAR017. Any decision regarding contraception after JCAR017 infusion should be discussed with the treating physician * True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. In contrast, periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception";The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:  Subject has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study Subject

The duration of each treatment course is 43 days.Subjects then be randomized to receive lenalidomide or procarbazine as maintenance therapy. Lenalidomide is given 25 mg/d per os, days 1 to 21 every 4 weeks for 24 courses.IIActive ComparatorRituximab + Methotrexate + Procarbazine + LenalidomideSubjects in part A receive 2 courses of induction chemo-immunotherapy i.e., rituximab at a dose of 375 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) on days -6, 1, 15, 29, methotrexate 3 g/m2 0.5 g/m2 in 15 minutes +2.5 g/m2 in 3-hr infusion on days 2,16,30, procarbazine 60 mg/m2/d oral on days 2 to 11. The duration of each treatment course is 43 days.Subjects then randomized to receive lenalidomide or procarbazine as maintenance therapy. Procarbazine is given 100 mg/d per os, days 1 to 5 every 4 weeks for 6 courses.IIIComparatorRadiotherapy + Temozolomide + RituximabSubjects ineligible for high-dose-methotrexate are treated in the single-arm phase II part B of the trial and receive whole-brain radiotherapy (2340 cGy in 5 weekly fractions), temozolomide 75 mg/m2/d during radiotherapy, 4 weekly doses of rituximab 375 mg/m2, starting on day 2 of the whole-brain radiotherapy.Subjects then receive maintenance therapy with 12 courses of temozolomide administered on days 1-5, every 4 weeks at a dose of 150 mg/m2/d at the first course, and of 200 mg/m2/d at the subsequent courses.Doses of drugs:Rituximab:Part A induction phase: During the primary chemo-immunotherapy (PRIMAIN regimen, 2 courses; every 43 days) administered as induction in the part A of the study, Rituximab is given 375 mg/m2 as standard infusion at days -6, 1, 15 and 29. Rituximab on day -6 is delivered only during the first course; it is delivered between day -6 and day 0 according to clinical requirements and subject's conditions. Some subjects would need for a fast chemotherapy starting.Part B induction phase: Subjects ineligible for high-dose methotrexate, assigned to receive concomitant whole brain radiotherapy-temozolomide-rituximab (Induction Part B). Rituximab is given 375 mg/m2 in 4 weekly doses, starting on day 2 of radiotherapy.Methotrexate: During the primary chemo-immunotherapy (PRIMAIN regimen, 2 courses; every 43 days) administered as induction in the PART A of the study, Methotrexate is given 3 g/m2 as infusion (0.5 g/m2 in 15 min. + 2.5 g/m2 in 3-hr infusion) on days 2, 16 & 30Procarbazine:Part A induction phase: During the primary chemo-immunotherapy (PRIMAIN regimen, 2 courses; every 43 days) administered as induction in the PART A of the study, Procarbazine is given oral 60 mg/m2/d from days 2 to 11Part A Maintenance phase (control arm): Subjects responsive or with stable disease after two courses of PRIMAIN regimen (the induction treatment) are randomly allocated to receive two different maintenance therapies. Maintenance start on day 60 of the 2nd PRIMAIN course. Procarbazine represents the control arm and is given oral 100 mg/d from day 1 to 5 for 6 courses, every 4 weeks.Lenalidomide: Subjects responsive or with stable disease after two courses of PRIMAIN regimen (the induction treatment) are randomly allocated to receive two different maintenance therapies. Maintenance start on day 60 of the 2nd PRIMAIN course. Lenalidomide represents the experimental arm and is given oral 25 mg/d from day 1 to 21 for 24 courses; every 4 weeks.Radiotherapy:subjects ineligible for high-dose methotrexate, are assigned to receive concomitant whole brain radiotherapy-temozolomide-rituximab (Induction Part B). Whole-brain are irradiated by two opposite lateral fields including the first two cervical vertebras and the posterior two thirds of the eyes. Photons of 4 - 10 MeV, 180 - 200 cGy per day, 5 weekly fractions is employedTemozolomide:Part B - Induction Phase: Subjects ineligible for high-dose methotrexate, are assigned to receive concomitant whole brain radiotherapy-temozolomide-rituximab (Induction Part B). Temoyolomide is given 75 mg/m2/d, every day for the whole duration of radiotherapy.Part B - Maintenance Phase: Temozolomide is also given as maintenance in Part B. The treatment consists of 12 courses where temozolomide is administered on days 1-5, every 4 weeks at a dose of 150 mg/m2/d at the first course, and of 200 mg/m2/d at the subsequent courses,Subjects eligible for high-dose methotrexate-based induction chemotherapy enter the run-in phase of Part A of the study and after the induction phase are randomly assigned to procarbazine or lenalidomide maintenance monotherapy. Forty assessable subjects per treatment arm are required.Subjects ineligible for high-dose methotrexate-based induction chemotherapy treated în Part B with concomitant whole-brain radiotherapy, temozolomide and rituximab and receive temozolomide as maintenance. According to the Simon's two-stage minimax design, 46 subjects treated in the first stage. If = 16 subjects progression-free at 2 years from maintenance treatment start, the study id stopped. Otherwise, 19 additional subjects treated for a total of 65Part A: The more fit subjects receive the standard chemotherapy combination (high-dose methotrexate, procarbazine and rituximab) as induction. Responding subjects subsequently be randomized to receive either procarbazine or lenalidomide as maintenance therapy. The Part A of the present trial consists of a randomized phase II trial conducted in elderly subjects with newly diagnosed PCNSL responsive to high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy, comparing two different maintenance strategies: the oral chemotherapeutic drug procarbazine and the oral immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide.Part B: The more fragile subjects receive a less aggressive therapy consisting of concomitant whole-brain radiotherapy, temozolomide and rituximab as induction therapy, followed by temozolomide as maintenance treatment. In the Part B of the present trial, temozolomide and rituximab, two agents active against PCNSL are delivered concomitantly to whole-brain radiotherapy to obtain a synergistic effect of radiation damage, antineoplastic effect of rituximab and cytostatic and radiomimetic effects of temozolomide. Finally, temozolomide maintenance has shown to be beneficial regarding sustained remission after initial response to induction therapy and its suitability to improve disease control in responding subjects not fit for more aggressive therapies therefore be tested in the Part B of this trial.All subjects aged =70 years taken into care at the participating sites invited to participate and after informed consent signature their baseline data is collected in the trial database, including data of subjects resulting in screening failure. This allow to verify any potential screening bias by comparing the characteristics of included and excluded subjects. Subjects fulfilling the eligibility criteria are then screened for their suitability to receive a more or less aggressive anticancer treatment and assigned to two different treatment strategies accordingly.A total of 208 subjects are planned to be enrolled in this study.";;;15-Jun-2019;31-Oct-2023;53,30;208;;;;;;;;;;"Primary Intervention
